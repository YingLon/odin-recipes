    <h2>Brazillian feijoada, a sunday classic!</h2>
    <p>Brazil's national dish, loved by everyone. It is a stew loaded with black beans and meats of every description: smoked pork loin, bacon and sausage such as chorizo.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds dried black beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
        <li>3 1/2 quarts water</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh spicy sausage, such as linguiça</li>
        <li>3/4 pound dried beef (carne seca) or corned beef, in one piece</li>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds smoked pork chops</li>
        <li>3/4 pound lean slab bacon</li>
        <li>3/4 pound chorizo, in one piece</li>
        <li>1 dried red chile</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
         <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy casserole. Add the garlic and onion and cook over moderately low heat, stirring occasionally, until the onion is softened, about 7 minutes.</li>
         <li>Stir in the drained black beans.</li>
         <li>Add the water to the casserole and bring to a boil over moderately high heat.</li>
         <li>Reduce the heat to low and simmer the beans for 1 hour, stirring occasionally.</li>
         <li>Add all of the meats and the dried chile and cook until the beans are tender, about 1 hour longer.</li>
         <li>Remove the meats from the casserole and thickly slice them; discard any bones.</li>
         <li>Pick out and discard the chile.</li>
         <li>Season the beans with salt. Ladle the beans into shallow bowls and serve with the sliced meats.</li>
         <li>ass the toasted manioc flour at the table for sprinkling over the feijoada.</li>

    </ol>
    <h1>Suggested Pairing</h2>
    <p>Pairing feijoada, Brazil's national dish, with Malbec, Argentina's national wine, is like a World Cup match — except that both sides win. Full-flavored Malbecs from the San Juan region stand up particularly well to feijoada's smoky and hearty flavors.</p>
